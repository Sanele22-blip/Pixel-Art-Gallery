    Welcome to my Pixel Art gallery
</h1>
<p>
    I created this gallery using pixel art images to express what I love and what matters to me. Each picture tells a story about my interests and dreams. From my favorite travel destinations to my beloved pets, these images represent a part of who I am. I hope you enjoy exploring my gallery and discovering more about me through these pixel art creations.

    Abu Dhabi is my dream destination because of its beautiful architecture and delicious cuisine. The city has beautiful buildings, such as the iconic Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque. Moreover, the local cuisine looks delicious, and I cannot wait to try it one day.

    Favourite animal (Cat)
</h2>
<img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="Cat">
<p>
    I love cats because they're special and bring happiness. I once had a cat; her name was Candy, and she was so beautiful and energetic. One day, we couldn't find her, and we thought she was missing. Then we saw her sleeping in my shoes, and I was so relieved and happy. Losing her was sad. I cannot wait to get another cat soon. They make me happy, and I can't wait to experience that again.

    <p>
        My favorite fruit is a banana. They taste good and are healthy. One day, I ate seven bananas! They were so yummy, and I couldn't stop eating them. Bananas are my favorite snack because they're delicious and give me energy.

    Music
</h2>

<p>
    I love listening to music, especially pop and gospel. When I'm feeling sad, music helps me feel better. It's like a friend that understands me, and the melodies lift my spirits. Pop and gospel music, in particular, have a way of touching my heart and bringing comfort during tough times.

<h2>Mental health</h2>

<p>
    Mental health is vital because it affects all parts of our lives. Just like physical health, it impacts our happiness and how well we cope with life. By taking care of our mental health, we can handle stress better and lead more fulfilling lives. It's important to talk about mental health openly and make sure everyone can get the support they need to thrive.
