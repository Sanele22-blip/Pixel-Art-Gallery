        Abu Dhabi is my dream destination because of its beautiful architecture and delicious cuisine. The city has beautiful buildings, such as the iconic Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, which fascinates me with its grandeur. Moreover, the local cuisine looks delicious, and I can't wait to try it one day.

    I love cats because they're special and bring happiness. I once had a cat named Candy, she was so beautiful and energetic. One day, we  couldn't find her, we thought she was missing. After hours looking for her we found her sleeping in my shoes. Losing her was sad, but I cannot wait to get another cat soon. They make me happy and I can't wait to have that again.
